//Hash map that contains more than 8 nodes
select h from java.util.HashMap h where h.size > 8

//Print the size of every hashmap. It will print them in a list in visualvm
select count(h) from java.util.HashMap h

//Prints the number of hashmap that have a size bigger than 8. It just prints a number
select count(heap.objects('java.util.HashMap'),"it.size>8")

//Print the number of hashmaps that have a size of 1
