The jvisual OQL language is for searching your memory dump is done functionally. If you have no experience with functional programming as a java programmer then you need to change your mind set. After a few examples you should see how OQL deals with the information and how it is printed.

There are simple memory dumps in the repo to test the OQL examples with. I have included the source code that i used to create these dumps so you can see what information is available to search with OQL. The example queries work with this sample program.


Jvisualvm is only available with oracle JDK and not openjdk.
