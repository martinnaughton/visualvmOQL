The jvisual jql for searching your memory dump is done functionally. If you have no experience with functional programming as a java programmer then you need to change your mind set. After a few examples you should see how jql is deals with the information and how it is printed.

There are simple memory dumps in the repo to test the jql examples with. I have included the source code that i used to create these dumps so you can see what information is available to search with jql. 


Jvisualvm is only available with oracle JDK and not openjdk.
